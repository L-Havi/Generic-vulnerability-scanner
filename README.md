This program can be used to map generic vulnerabilities that may occur in a website. 
Note that more abstract vulnerabilities wont be most likely found using this tool.

This is a tool that can currently locate XSS, SQL injection and open port vulnerabilities. More scanning options might be added in future

It works in any UNIX based operating systems and in Windows if Python is installed

## Usage

```
Syntax: python vulnerability_scanner.py


[*] Example:
    python vulnerability_scanner.py             Starts to scan website with given parameters and reports progress

```

## Example of setting up scanner

Target website in this example is set to a webpage in [Metasploitable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/) which is
intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine.

[*] Parameters:

  Port:                           Port variable takes a number (For example 1024) of ports that the program will scan. 
                                  If number is 1024 program will scan ports 1-1024

  Target URL:                     target_url variable set to website's domain which is hosted in metasploitable's local IP address 
                                  and subfolder dvwa ("http://192.168.183.130/dvwa/")
  
  
  Links to ignore:                This is optional variable that excludes domains set to it. In this example logout page was 
                                  excluded to prevent logout ("ttp://192.168.183.130/dvwa/logout.php")
  
  
  Data dictionary:                Another optional variable used if you need to pass data to a session in scan. In this example
                                  login info was given to the scanner {"username": "admin","password": "password", "Login": "submit"}
  
  
  Vulnerability scanner session:  Use this if you need to create a session to post data to webpage. In this example it is used
                                  to pass the login info to login page 
                                  ("vuln_scanner.session.post("http://192.168.183.130/dvwa/login.php", data=data_dict)")
